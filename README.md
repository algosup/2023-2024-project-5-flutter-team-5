## Description 🔎
Adopte Un Candidat is a "Tinder style" recruitment application that matches companies with jobseekers in an innovative way. The application is designed to be accessible on phone, tablet, and computer.

## Concept 💡
The key points of the Adopte Un Candidat concept are as follows:

- **Anonymization of candidates and companies:** To avoid discrimination in hiring, both candidates and companies are anonymized on the platform, allowing the focus to be on candidates' skills and potential.
- **Valuing soft skills:** The platform emphasizes soft skills such as communication, teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving, rather than focusing solely on diplomas and professional experience.
- **Priority given to the human aspect:** Each candidate's unique talents and skills are recognized, giving everyone the opportunity to showcase their abilities.
- **Matching process:** The application enables candidates and companies to find an ideal match based on preferences and organizational needs, using a "Tinder" style matching process.
- **Using an application:** The recruitment process is facilitated through a dedicated application, offering features such as messaging and personalized profiles.

## Features 🚀
- Anonymized profiles for candidates and companies
- Focus on soft skills over traditional qualifications
