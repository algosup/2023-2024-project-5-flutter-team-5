## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
**Adopte 1 Candidat** is an application designed to help companies recruit candidates for their job openings.

The application is available on Android and Windows platforms.

### 1.2 Goals

- Candidates have an anonymous profile
- Each user can Like, Pass or Cancel other users
- If their have a match, they can chat together, the company alway send the first message 

- Available on Android and Windows
- Only display job offer in a radius around you
- Candidates share their hard skills and soft skills.
- Companies share their job offer, salary, schedule and perks
