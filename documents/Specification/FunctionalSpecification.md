## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
**Adopte 1 Candidat** is an application designed to help companies recruit candidates for their job openings. Inspired by the dating app Tinder, it allows companies to create job listings and candidates to apply for them. The company can then accept or reject applicants, who have anonymous profiles. Similarly, candidates can accept or reject job offers. If both the company and the candidate accept each other, they can start a conversation. The application is available on Android and Windows platforms.

### 1.2 Goals

- Two type of users: company and candidate
- Candidates have an anonymous profile
- Each user can Like, Pass or Cancel other users
- If their have a match, they can chat together, the company alway send the first message 

- Available on Android and Windows
- Only display job offer in a radius around you
- Candidates share their hard skills and soft skills.
- Companies share their job offer, salary, schedule and perks

## 2. Solution 

### 2.1 Product Overview

To respond to the client's request, we have decided to create a flutter application. The main functionality is the "Swipe" profile feature. The user can like, pass or cancel another user. If the user like another user and the other user like back, they can chat together. The company user can send the first message after the match. The user can also access to the profile of another user, the search page, the notification log, the message page, the setting page, the filter page and the match history page. The user can also edit his profile, set his location, logout and delete his account.


## 3. Functional Requirements

<!-- Add a part defining the different pages and their functions before doing the use cases as they are currently referring to pages that are not defined-->
<!-- Define what should go in the user profile-->
<!-- Define what should be in the filters-->


### 3.1 Personas

![Candidate](Image/CandidatePersona.png)

<!-- CEO persona seem to be a really poor fit for the use case. As he is seemingly looking more for hard than soft skills -->

### 3.2 Use cases

<!-- Add indications of what to do in Alternate flow or Exception flow-->
